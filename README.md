## Findings/Conclusion
1. From Dashboard 1 and 2: Based on the top bar chart in Dashboard 1, the max resale price has been increasing since 2013 to Dec 2023. The highest resale price recorded in Year 2023 was $1.5 million for a 5room flat in Bukit Merah town.
2. From Dashboard 1: Based on the Pie Chart, 4-room flat type takes up 41.5% of the total flat sold for the past 11 years. It may be easier to sell 4-room flat in the future as the transaction % is the highest indicating higher market interest.
3. From Dashboard 1: Based on the bottom bar chart, the resale flat prices seems to have fallen from 2013 to 2018 and started rising again from 2019 onwards.
4. From Dashboard 2: The most expensive towns to buy a flat in is in Bukit Merah and Central Area of Singapore, while the cheapest towns are Choa Chu Kang and Sembawang.
5. From Dashboard 2: Based on the scattered plot, most people are selling their flats in Punggol, Sengkang, Woodlands and Yishun. One possible reason could be these estates has quite a number of BTO flats built in the recent years and these flat might have just reached the 5 year MOP, so many first-time buyers have sold their flat to upgrade.
